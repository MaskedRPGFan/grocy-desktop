# grocy-desktop
A (Windows) desktop application wrapper for [grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy)

## Motivation
grocy is a selfhosted PHP web application, so normally runs on webservers. If you are not so familiar with the technical things regarding webservers, but just want to have grocy running like a normal (Windows) desktop application, this is what you need.

## How to install
- Classic installer
  - Just download and execute the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest-desktop), afterwards you will have a shortcut on your desktop which starts grocy.
- Microsoft Store  
<a href="//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nwb1trnnksf?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge"><img src="https://assets.windowsphone.com/85864462-9c82-451e-9355-a3d5f874397a/English_get-it-from-MS_InvariantCulture_Default.png" alt="Get it from Microsoft" width="150px" /></a>

Please note that the user data is not automatically transfered when switching between the classic installer and the Microsoft Store version, please use the [backup/restore functionality](#how-to-backuprestore) to transfer your data.

## How to update
Just download and execute the [latest release](https://releases.grocy.info/latest-desktop). grocy itself can also be updated separately (top menu bar `grocy -> Update`).

## How to backup/restore
All grocy user data can be exported and restored as a ZIP file (see the `File` menu in the top menu bar).

## Localization
grocy-desktop is fully localizable - the default language is English (integrated into code), a German localization is always maintained by me.
You can easily help translating grocy at https://www.transifex.com/grocy/grocy-desktop, if your language is incomplete or not available yet.
(grocy-desktop and grocy will use automatically the localization based on your system language, if available.)

## Things worth to know

### How this works technically
grocy-desktop is a .Net Windows Forms application. It uses [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) as an integrated browser and utilizes the in PHP integrated development server to host grocy. The UWP app (Appx package to be distributed through the Microsoft Store) is built using the [Desktop Bridge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bridges/desktop), all needed dependencies/manifests are located in the `appx_dependencies` folder.

### What the installer does
The installer has bundled, beside the application itself and the CefSharp dependencies, a for grocy configured PHP version (in `embedded_dependencies/php.zip`) and the current grocy release. grocy itself can also be updated separately, see above. Everything will be unpacked to `%localappdata%\grocy-desktop` by default, the path can also be changed during the installation process. (This does not apply when running/installing the UWP app, normally from the Microsoft Store - UWP apps have their own default package locations.)

### What happens on start
grocy-desktop will do the following things and then opens the locally hosted instance in the integrated browser:
- Unpacking the dependency ZIP files, if needed, to `%appdata%\grocy-desktop\runtime-dependencies` and grocy itself to `%appdata%\grocy-desktop\grocy`
  - When running the UWP app (normally installed from the Microsoft Store), the used paths are `%userprofile%\.grocy-desktop\runtime-dependencies` and `%userprofile%\.grocy-desktop\grocy`
- Configuring grocy in embedded mode (it will save its data in `%appdata%\grocy-desktop\grocy-data`, this path can be changed (top menu bar `File -> Configure/change data location`)
  - When running the UWP app (normally installed from the Microsoft Store), the default path is `%userprofile%\.grocy-desktop\grocy-data`
- Starting a PHP development server on a free random port, bound to localhost

### How to build
You will need Visual Studio 2019. All dependencies are included, available via NuGet or will be downloaded at compile time (see build events).
The setup is built using [WiX Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org), which should be installed along with the [Wix Toolset Visual Studio 2019 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WixToolset.WixToolsetVisualStudio2019Extension).
To build the Appx package (UWP app) you will need the [Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) (this is done in the Post-build event of the `grocy-desktop-setup` project).
